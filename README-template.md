## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery/Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
  - I thought it would be a good exercise to use html entities for the operands values in the html file, instead of just the operands as is : +,- etc. And to work with the html entities in the js file. 
  I found a stackoverflow post on how to convert html entities to characters (see link 1)
   

### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.
